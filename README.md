# Grab-Safety-Submission
Modelling exercise for Grab AI Challenge: Safety dataset

**Project Plan**

Understand the data and telematics sufficiently enough to proceed with the exercise
Decide on a most reasonable format to transform and extract features from the data before modelling
Choose a suitable algorithm (or ensemble) that gives reasonable test results

**Modelling**

Tried 3 models: XGB, RFC, NN
All 3 models gave the results of ~75% accuracy.

**Future work**

Build model to classify mobile phone behavior from the acceleration and gyroscope data.
Build model to detect lane switch
